    <p>La version 1.8.4 est sortie le 23 août. Beaucoup de choses au menu avec plus de
870 changements (venant de plus de 100 contributeurs). Le changelog est donc
particulièrement bien fourni. Voici quelques points clés :</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">git log</tt> a une option "-Lbegin,end:filename". Encore expérimentale, elle
permet de spécifier un range (désolé pour l'anglicisme mais j'ai du mal à
trouver une terme français aussi explicite).</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">git clean</tt> possède maintenant un mode interactif qui reprend celui de
<tt class="docutils literal">git add</tt>.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">git submodule</tt> peut être appelé des sous-répertoires, et une nouvelle
variable <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">submodule.*.update</span></tt> permet d'invoquer une commande. De plus,
on peut cloner un dépôt en mode <tt class="docutils literal">shallow</tt>.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">git rebase <span class="pre">-i</span></tt> gère maintenant les options <tt class="docutils literal">strategy</tt> et <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-X</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Pendant un <tt class="docutils literal">git rebase –autostash</tt>, on peut sauver le stash avant de
lancer l'opération.</li>
<li>2 nouvelles variables <tt class="docutils literal">status.branch</tt> et <tt class="docutils literal">status.short</tt> pour éviter de
taper <tt class="docutils literal">git status <span class="pre">-branch</span></tt> et <tt class="docutils literal">git status <span class="pre">-short</span></tt>.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">git log</tt> possède une nouvelle option <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">–author-date-order</span></tt>.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">git diff</tt> a un nouveau mode pour ignorer les additions ou suppressions
de lignes vides.</li>
<li>La variable <tt class="docutils literal">color.ui</tt> est maintenant sur <tt class="docutils literal">auto</tt>.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">git <span class="pre">name-rev</span></tt> peut nommer un tag annoté à partir de son nom.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">git describe</tt> possède maintenant l'option <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">–first-parent</span></tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A noter que la version 2.0 devrait sortir l'année prochaine.</p>
<div class="section" id="changelog">
<h2>Changelog</h2>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Cygwin port has been updated for more recent Cygwin 1.7.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git rebase -i" now honors --strategy and -X options.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Git-gui has been updated to its 0.18.0 version.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">MediaWiki remote helper (in contrib/) has been updated to use the
credential helper interface from Git.pm.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Update build for Cygwin 1.[57].  Torsten Bögershausen reports that
this is fine with Cygwin 1.7 ($gmane/225824) so let's try moving it
ahead.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The credential helper to talk to keychain on OS X (in contrib/) has
been updated to kick in not just when talking http/https but also
imap(s) and smtp.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Remote transport helper has been updated to report errors and
maintain ref hierarchy used to keep track of its own state better.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">With "export" remote-helper protocol, (1) a push that tries to
update a remote ref whose name is different from the pushing side
does not work yet, and (2) the helper may not know how to do
--dry-run; these problematic cases are disabled for now.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">git-remote-hg/bzr (in contrib/) updates.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">git-remote-mw (in contrib/) hints users to check the certificate,
when <a class="reference external" href="https://">https://</a> connection failed.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">git-remote-mw (in contrib/) adds a command to allow previewing the
contents locally before pushing it out, when working with a
MediaWiki remote.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Sample "post-receive-email" hook script got an enhanced replacement
"multimail" (in contrib/).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Also in contrib/ is a new "contacts" script that runs "git blame"
to find out the people who may be interested in a set of changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git clean" command learned an interactive mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The "--head" option to "git show-ref" was only to add "HEAD" to the
list of candidate refs to be filtered by the usual rules
(e.g. "--heads" that only show refs under refs/heads).  The meaning
of the option has been changed to always show "HEAD" regardless of
what filtering will be applied to any other ref.</p>
<p>This is a backward incompatible change and might cause breakages to
people's existing scripts.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git show -s" was less discoverable than it should have been.  It
now has a natural synonym "git show --no-patch".</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git check-mailmap" is a new command that lets you map usernames
and e-mail addresses through the mailmap mechanism, just like many
built-in commands do.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git name-rev" learned to name an annotated tag object back to its
tagname; "git name-rev $(git rev-parse v1.0.0)" gives "tags/v1.0.0",
for example.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git cat-file --batch-check=&lt;format&gt;" is added, primarily to allow
on-disk footprint of objects in packfiles (often they are a lot
smaller than their true size, when expressed as deltas) to be
reported.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git rebase [-i]" used to leave just "rebase" as its reflog messages
for some operations. They have been reworded to be more informative.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In addition to the choice from "rebase, merge, or checkout-detach",
"submodule update" can allow a custom command to be used in to
update the working tree of submodules via the "submodule.*.update"
configuration variable.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git submodule update" can optionally clone the submodule
repositories shallowly.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git format-patch" learned "--from[=whom]" option, which sets the
"From: " header to the specified person (or the person who runs the
command, if "=whom" part is missing) and move the original author
information to an in-body From: header as necessary.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The configuration variable "merge.ff" was cleary a tri-state to
choose one from "favor fast-forward when possible", "always create
a merge even when the history could fast-forward" and "do not
create any merge, only update when the history fast-forwards", but
the command line parser did not implement the usual convention of
"last one wins, and command line overrides the configuration"
correctly.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"gitweb" learned to optionally place extra links that point at the
levels higher than the Gitweb pages themselves in the breadcrumbs,
so that it can be used as part of a larger installation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git log --format=" now honors i18n.logoutputencoding configuration
variable.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The "push.default=simple" mode of "git push" has been updated to
behave like "current" without requiring a remote tracking
information, when you push to a remote that is different from where
you fetch from (i.e. a triangular workflow).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Having multiple "fixup!" on a line in the rebase instruction sheet
did not work very well with "git rebase -i --autosquash".</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git log" learned the "--author-date-order" option, with which the
output is topologically sorted and commits in parallel histories
are shown intermixed together based on the author timestamp.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Various subcommands of "git submodule" refused to run from anywhere
other than the top of the working tree of the superproject, but
they have been taught to let you run from a subdirectory.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git diff" learned a mode that ignores hunks whose change consists
only of additions and removals of blank lines, which is the same as
"diff -B" (ignore blank lines) of GNU diff.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git rm" gives a single message followed by list of paths to report
multiple paths that cannot be removed.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git rebase" can be told with ":/look for this string" syntax commits
to replay the changes onto and where the work to be replayed begins.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Many tutorials teach users to set "color.ui" to "auto" as the first
thing after you set "user.name/email" to introduce yourselves to
Git.  Now the variable defaults to "auto".</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">On Cygwin, "cygstart" is now recognised as a possible way to start
a web browser (used in "help -w" and "instaweb" among others).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git status" learned status.branch and status.short configuration
variables to use --branch and --short options by default (override
with --no-branch and --no-short options from the command line).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git cmd &lt;name&gt;", when &lt;name&gt; happens to be a 40-hex string,
directly uses the 40-hex string as an object name, even if a ref
"refs/&lt;some hierarchy&gt;/&lt;name&gt;" exists.  This disambiguation order
is unlikely to change, but we should warn about the ambiguity just
like we warn when more than one refs/ hierarchies share the same
name.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git rebase" learned "--[no-]autostash" option to save local
changes instead of refusing to run (to which people's normal
response was to stash them and re-run).  This introduced a corner
case breakage to "git am --abort" but it has been fixed.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"check-ignore" (new feature since 1.8.2) has been updated to work
more like "check-attr" over bidi-pipes.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git describe" learned "--first-parent" option to limit its closest
tagged commit search to the first-parent chain.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git merge foo" that might have meant "git merge origin/foo" is
diagnosed with a more informative error message.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git log -L&lt;line&gt;,&lt;range&gt;:&lt;filename&gt;" has been added.  This may
still have leaks and rough edges, though.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">We used the approxidate() parser for "--expire=&lt;timestamp&gt;" options
of various commands, but it is better to treat --expire=all and
--expire=now a bit more specially than using the current timestamp.
"git gc" and "git reflog" have been updated with a new parsing
function for expiry dates.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Updates to completion (both bash and zsh) helpers.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The behaviour of the "--chain-reply-to" option of "git send-email"
have changed at 1.7.0, and we added a warning/advice message to
help users adjust to the new behaviour back then, but we kept it
around for too long.  The message has finally been removed.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git fetch origin master" unlike "git fetch origin" or "git fetch"
did not update "refs/remotes/origin/master"; this was an early
design decision to keep the update of remote tracking branches
predictable, but in practice it turns out that people find it more
convenient to opportunistically update them whenever we have a
chance, and we have been updating them when we run "git push" which
already breaks the original "predictability" anyway.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The configuration variable core.checkstat was advertised in the
documentation but the code expected core.statinfo instead.
For now, we accept both core.checkstat and core.statinfo, but the
latter will be removed in the longer term.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">On Cygwin, we used to use our own lstat(2) emulation that is
allegedly faster than the platform one in codepaths where some of
the information it returns did not matter, but it started to bite
us in a few codepaths where the trick it uses to cheat does show
breakages. This emulation has been removed and we use the native
lstat(2) emulation supplied by Cygwin now.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The function attributes extensions are used to catch mistakes in
use of our own variadic functions that use NULL sentinel at the end
(i.e. like execl(3)) and format strings (i.e. like printf(3)).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The code to allow configuration data to be read from in-tree blob
objects is in.  This may help working in a bare repository and
submodule updates.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Fetching between repositories with many refs employed O(n^2)
algorithm to match up the common objects, which has been corrected.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The original way to specify remote repository using .git/branches/
used to have a nifty feature.  The code to support the feature was
still in a function but the caller was changed not to call it 5
years ago, breaking that feature and leaving the supporting code
unreachable.  The dead code has been removed.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git pack-refs" that races with new ref creation or deletion have
been susceptible to lossage of refs under right conditions, which
has been tightened up.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">We read loose and packed references in two steps, but after
deciding to read a loose ref but before actually opening it to read
it, another process racing with us can unlink it, which would cause
us to barf.  The codepath has been updated to retry when such a
race is detected, instead of outright failing.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Uses of the platform fnmatch(3) function (many places in the code,
matching pathspec, .gitignore and .gitattributes to name a few)
have been replaced with wildmatch, allowing "foo/**/bar" that would
match foo/bar, foo/a/bar, foo/a/b/bar, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Memory ownership and lifetime rules for what for-each-ref feeds to
its callbacks have been clarified (in short, "you do not own it, so
make a copy if you want to keep it").</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The revision traversal logic to improve culling of irrelevant
parents while traversing a mergy history has been updated.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Some leaks in unpack-trees (used in merge, cherry-pick and other
codepaths) have been plugged.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The codepath to read from marks files in fast-import/export did not
have to accept anything but 40-hex representation of the object
name.  Further, fast-export did not need full in-core object
representation to have parsed wen reading from them.  These
codepaths have been optimized by taking advantage of these access
patterns.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Object lookup logic, when the object hashtable starts to become
crowded, has been optimized.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When TEST_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY setting is used, it was handled somewhat
inconsistently between the test framework and t/Makefile, and logic
to summarize the results looked at a wrong place.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git clone" uses a lighter-weight implementation when making sure
that the history behind refs are complete.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Many warnings from sparse source checker in compat/ area has been
squelched.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The code to reading and updating packed-refs file has been updated,
correcting corner case bugs.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Newer Net::SMTP::SSL module does not want the user programs to use
the default behaviour to let server certificate go without
verification, so by default enable the verification with a
mechanism to turn it off if needed.
(merge 35035bb rr/send-email-ssl-verify later to maint).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When "git" is spawned in such a way that any of the low 3 file
descriptors is closed, our first open() may yield file descriptor 2,
and writing error message to it would screw things up in a big way.
(merge a11c396 tr/protect-low-3-fds later to maint).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The mailmap mechanism unnecessarily downcased the e-mail addresses
in the output, and also ignored the human name when it is a single
character name.
(merge bd23794 jc/mailmap-case-insensitivity later to maint).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In two places we did not check return value (expected to be a file
descriptor) correctly.
(merge a77f106 tr/fd-gotcha-fixes later to maint).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Logic to auto-detect character encodings in the commit log message
did not reject overlong and invalid UTF-8 characters.
(merge 81050ac bc/commit-invalid-utf8 later to maint).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Pass port number as a separate argument when "send-email" initializes
Net::SMTP, instead of as a part of the hostname, i.e. host:port.
This allows GSSAPI codepath to match with the hostname given.
(merge 1a741bf bc/send-email-use-port-as-separate-param later to maint).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git diff" refused to even show difference when core.safecrlf is
set to true (i.e. error out) and there are offending lines in the
working tree files.
(merge 5430bb2 jc/maint-diff-core-safecrlf later to maint).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A test that should have failed but didn't revealed a bug that needs
to be corrected.
(merge 94d75d1 jc/t1512-fix later to maint).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">An overlong path to a .git directory may have overflown the
temporary path buffer used to create a name for lockfiles.
(merge 2fbd4f9 mh/maint-lockfile-overflow later to maint).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Invocations of "git checkout" used internally by "git rebase" were
counted as "checkout", and affected later "git checkout -" to the
the user to an unexpected place.
(merge 3bed291 rr/rebase-checkout-reflog later to maint).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The configuration variable column.ui was poorly documented.
(merge 5e62cc1 rr/column-doc later to maint).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git name-rev --refs=tags/v*" were forbidden, which was a bit
inconvenient (you had to give a pattern to match refs fully, like
--refs=refs/tags/v*).
(merge 98c5c4a nk/name-rev-abbreviated-refs later to maint).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git apply" parsed patches that add new files, generated by
programs other than Git, incorrectly.  This is an old breakage in
v1.7.11 and will need to be merged down to the maintenance tracks.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Older cURL wanted piece of memory we call it with to be stable, but
we updated the auth material after handing it to a call.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git pull" into nothing trashed "local changes" that were in the
index, and this avoids it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Many "git submodule" operations do not work on a submodule at a
path whose name is not in ASCII.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"cherry-pick" had a small leak in an error codepath.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Logic used by git-send-email to suppress cc mishandled names like
"A U. Thor" &lt;<a class="reference external" href="mailto:author@example.xz">author@example.xz</a>&gt;, where the human readable part
needs to be quoted (the user input may not have the double quotes
around the name, and comparison was done between quoted and
unquoted strings).  It also mishandled names that need RFC2047
quoting.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Call to discard_cache/discard_index (used when we use different
contents of the index in-core, in many operations like commit,
apply, and merge) used to leak memory that held the array of index
entries, which has been plugged.
(merge a0fc4db rs/discard-index-discard-array later to maint).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"gitweb" forgot to clear a global variable $search_regexp upon each
request, mistakenly carrying over the previous search to a new one
when used as a persistent CGI.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The wildmatch engine did not honor WM_CASEFOLD option correctly.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git log -c --follow $path" segfaulted upon hitting the commit that
renamed the $path being followed.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When a reflog notation is used for implicit "current branch", we
did not say which branch and worse said "branch ''".</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"difftool --dir-diff" did not copy back changes made by the
end-user in the diff tool backend to the working tree in some
cases.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git push $there HEAD:branch" did not resolve HEAD early enough, so
it was easy to flip it around while push is still going on and push
out a branch that the user did not originally intended when the
command was started.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The bash prompt code (in contrib/) displayed the name of the branch
being rebased when "rebase -i/-m/-p" modes are in use, but not the
plain vanilla "rebase".</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Handling of negative exclude pattern for directories "!dir" was
broken in the update to v1.8.3.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">zsh prompt script that borrowed from bash prompt script did not
work due to slight differences in array variable notation between
these two shells.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">An entry for "<a class="reference external" href="file://">file://</a>" scheme in the enumeration of URL types Git
can take in the HTML documentation was made into a clickable link
by mistake.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git push --[no-]verify" was not documented.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Stop installing the git-remote-testpy script that is only used for
testing.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git commit --allow-empty-message -m ''" should not start an
editor.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"git merge @{-1}~22" was rewritten to "git merge <a class="reference external" href="mailto:frotz@%7B1%7D~22">frotz@{1}~22</a>"
incorrectly when your previous branch was "frotz" (it should be
rewritten to "git merge frotz~22" instead).</p>
